Due to glibmm now requiring c++11, MM based ports will probably need to have
USES=compiler:c++11-lib and/or USE_CXXSTD=c++11. But don't add it blindly.

* Cheese reworked the device detection code, needs testing!

* Hack seahorse configure to not require specific 2.1 gnupg version.

* tracker -> nautilus -> tracker circulair dependancy. break tracker up in
  slave ports?

* check and bump our gnome-shell extensions

* lang/gcc needs a update to 4.9 or newer for webkit2-gtk3 on FreebSD 9.x
* x11-toolkits/gtkmm30 is broken on 9.x due to gcc 4.8 not knowning (I think)
  about std::stod which is new in c++11 and 4.8 might nog have it.

* version bump meta ports, gnome-utils, gnome-games gnome3

* Mk/Uses/gnome.mk and Mk/Uses/mate.mk needs revew about pre/post voodoo.
