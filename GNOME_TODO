Due to glibmm now requiring c++11, MM based ports will probably need to have
USES=compiler:c++11-lib and/or USE_CXXSTD=c++11. But don't add it blindly.

* [[Cheese reworked the device detection code, needs testing!]]
  Works fine, if user is added to the webcamd group!

* tracker -> nautilus -> tracker circulair dependancy. break tracker up in
  slave ports?

* check and bump our gnome-shell extensions

* lang/gcc needs a update to 4.9 or newer for webkit2-gtk3 on FreebSD 9.x
* x11-toolkits/gtkmm30 is broken on 9.x due to gcc 4.8 not knowning (I think)
  about std::stod which is new in c++11 and 4.8 might nog have it.

* Mk/Uses/gnome.mk and Mk/Uses/mate.mk needs revew about pre/post voodoo.

* GDM: something segfaults and it doesn't show login dialog. possible to
  do with my botching the consolekit patches.

* gnome-terminal not working (even with startx and a UTF-8 locale), not
  tested with a gdm session yet since gdm doesn't work yet.

* most of the third-party extensions have been bumped to support 3.18.
  Need testing.

* make sure x11-themes/mate-themes is 1 revision ahead of ports.
